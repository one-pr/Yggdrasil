# The version of this JLL is decoupled from the upstream version.
# Whenever we package a new upstream release, we initially map its
# version X.Y.Z to X00.Y00.Z00 (i.e., multiply each component by 100).
# So for example version 2.6.3 would become 200.600.300.
#
# Moreover, all our packages using this JLL use `~` in their compat ranges.
#
# Together, this allows us to increment the patch level of the JLL for minor tweaks.
# If a rebuild of the JLL is needed which keeps the upstream version identical
# but breaks ABI compatibility for any reason, we can increment the minor version
# e.g. go from 200.600.300 to 200.601.300.
# To package prerelease versions, we can also adjust the minor version; e.g. we may
# map a prerelease of 2.7.0 to 200.690.000.
#
# There is currently no plan to change the major version, except when upstream itself
# changes its major version. It simply seemed sensible to apply the same transformation
# to all components.
